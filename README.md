This archived repository holds the results of my 2016-2017 NCSSM Game Development Seminar and 2017 Game Development Miniterm.

My group of 4 students worked on a top-down roguelike shooter inspired by games like Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac.

The current version of the project has fireable weapons, randomly generated levels, and amateur textures.
