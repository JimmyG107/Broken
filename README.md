# Broken

This archived repository holds the results of my 2016-2017 NCSSM Game Development Seminar and 2017 Game Development Miniterm.

My group of 4 students worked on a top-down roguelike shooter inspired by games like Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac.

The current version of the project has fireable weapons, randomly generated levels, and amateur textures.

This codebase is for the GamMaker 1.4 engine, and is not distribution ready.

Additionally, a number of batch files are present in the repository. These were created by PikaBlue at the time to help those less familiar with Git (including myself) to navigate the at times complicated process of version control.
